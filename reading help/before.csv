ABSTRACT: Now a days the Use of Geographic Information System (GIS) has been increasing enormously. In
this study land use planning has been carriedout in GIS platform for Vijayawada urban city, Andhra Pradesh,
India. The obligatory data for urban planning have been collected from Vijayawada-Guntur-Tenali-Mangalagiri
Urban Development Authority (VGTMUDA). During the execution of the work Geo - Referencing, Digitization
and Attributing of different layers have been carriedout. Finally overlapping of all features has been carriedout
in GIS platform. From the output ‘Coverage map’, one can easily understand the existing features of the city
like aided high schools in the city, water distribution network, slum location, railway network etc. which are
useful for the decision makers to implement management strategies in GIS platform and suggestions are also
incorporated for the development of Vijayawada city.

1. INTRODUCTION
Geographic Information System (GIS) is a system for capturing, storing, analyzing and managing data and
associated attributes which are spatially referenced to the earth. GIS is a highly dynamic field, growing at very
rapid pace of technological change and increasing number of applications (Davis, 2001). In the strictest sense, it
is a computer system capable of integrating, storing, editing, analyzing, sharing, and displaying geographicallyreferenced
information. In a more generic sense, GIS is a tool that allows users to create interactive queries (user
created searches), analyze the spatial information, edit data, maps, and present the results of all these operations.
GIS technology can be used for scientific investigations, resource management, asset management,
environmental impact assessment, urban planning, cartography, criminology, history, sales, marketing, and
logistics. Table 1 lists a few of business sectors and how GIS technology can benefit them (Boyles, 2002;
Harder, 1997; Tomei L, 2008). This serves to demonstrate the wide ranging applicability of GIS technology for
business.

GIS might allow emergency planners to easily calculate emergency response times in the event of a natural
disaster, GIS might be used to find wetlands that need protection from pollution, or GIS can be used by a
company to site a new business to take advantage of a previously undeserved market. In this study GIS was used
for the application of urban planning to the Vijayawada city.
The area for which GIS is to be implemented, must have its features in the form of a picture. The
picture may be a topographical map, AutoCAD Drawing or satellite imagery. The data required for carrying out
the project was collected from Vijayawada Urban Development Authority (VUDA), in the form of ‘AutoCAD
drawings’ and ‘Ms Word documents’. Different kinds of data like, data pertaining to Road, Railway, Canal
networks, Ward boundaries, Slum areas, Origin and Destination points etc., and their attribute information that
is existing statistics, proposals were collected. The main steps involved for executing the project are (1) Geo
Referencing (2) Digitizing, and (3) Attributing.
2. GEO REFERENCING
Rectification involves the initial processing of raw image data to correct for geometric distortions, to calibrate
the data radiometrically, and to eliminate noise present in the data (lillesand, 2004). First the area under
consideration should be geo-referenced, that is. its position must be fixed with respect to latitude and longitude
correctly. For this purpose, the field survey has been performed at different locations of Vijayawada city with
GPS (Global Positioning System). In this study for the rectification of the AutoCAD map, four different
locations on the road network, for., Benz circle, intersection point of Eluru road with MG road, Ramavarappadu
circle and other point nearer to the Milk project are considered. Generally two types of data are to be required
for geo - referencing that are Raster data and Vector data
2.1. Raster Data:
Raster data refers to data that are stored as multi-dimensional arrays. It contains a matrix of values representing
the attribute property or properties (e.g. temperature, pressure, ozone concentration) at the locations where the
matrix elements locate. The spatial property (that is. the location of each matrix element) of raster data is
implicitly included in the spatial arrangement (that is. relative positions) of the matrix elements
The scanned image of any picture comes under Raster data, for., files of format .jpeg, .Mpeg, and .tiff.
This type of geo referencing needs the image or picture to be scanned and later open it in the “Arc Map”.
Having known the latitudes and longitudes of different points on the image, the raster image is geo referenced,
using the “Geo Referencing” toolbar. In this study the AutoCAD drawings are collected from Vijayawada urban
development authority and prepared these drawings into GIS format.
2.2. Vector Data:
Vector data refers to data that represents the spatial configuration of geospatial features as a set of directed line
segments. It is usually used to represent such features as rivers, contours, profiles, transportation lines, and
boundaries of natural and political regions.
In order to Geo Reference the AutoCAD drawing, it needs to be converted into a file format that is recognized
by Arc GIS. Hence the AutoCAD drawing is to be converted into a “coverage file”. For this purpose, a folder is
created first and the AutoCAD drawing is copied into it. The drawing is changed to “.DXF” file and is saved
into the same folder. After saving the drawing, ‘Arc Work Station’ is started and the .DXF file is converted into
a coverage (arc) file, using a series of commands and operations. Four Tics (points) are generated namely 1, 2,
3, 4 (Fig.1) which are to be placed on the chosen four points on the road network as stated earlier. Now, the
coverage file is geo referenced using four ‘Tics’ developed. They are individually selected and using the ‘drag’
option, they are placed exactly on the four known points, by ‘continuous zooming and dragging’. Later, the
latitude and longitude values are entered for the four points and the file is saved. The so saved coverage file is
opened in the Arc Map. Thus an image is formed, as shown in fig.3, which shows the values of latitude and
longitude of all the points on the map, wherever the cursor moves on. Thus, each layer for., Road, Railway
network, slums is separately geo referenced and saved.
3. DIGITIZATION
The final step of digital image formation is the digitization. This means sampling the gray values at a discrete
set of points, which can be represented by a matrix (Bernd jahne, 2005). Each layer of the map is geo referenced
with respect to the road network, that is. Whether it is slums or canals or whatever it may be, they are geo
referenced along with road network, since the known points are taken on the road network. Hence to have a
particular identity of each layer, it is to be digitized, excluding the road network.
A feature on a map can be identified either by a shape of a polygon, or a line, or a point. Three types of files are
available to generate such shapes.
1. Shapefile , 2. Personal Geo Data Base (PGDB) (Grey), 3. Coverage file (Yellow).
3.1. Shape file:
The shape file format is used commonly in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The format was developed
by Environmental Systems Research Institute (ESRI), and is tied to their Arc View and Arc GIS products (Ben
Fry, 2007)Shape files are simple because they store primitive geometrical data type of points, lines, and
polygons. These primitives are of limited use without any attributes to specify what they represent. Therefore, a
table of records will store properties/attributes for each primitive shape in the Shapefiles. Shapes
(points/lines/polygons) together with data attributes can create infinitely many representations about
geographical data, and depiction provides the ability for powerful and accurate computations.
3.2. Personal Geo Database (PGDB):
Geo database is the latest spatial data format commonly used, with all map data stored in relational database
format. The personal geo data base is built into Arc GIS and uses the Microsoft Access database engine
(Kurland, 2007).
3.3. Coverage file:
Coverage is stored in the computer as a directory. The directory name is the coverage name. An organized
collection of coverage is called a workspace. Coverage is composed of a set of files, each of which contains
information about a particular feature class. The set of files stored in coverage varies depending on the feature
classes present in coverage as shown in Table 2. For example, the illustration below shows a workspace that
contains a number of coverage’s. The directory structure and files contained in the coverage, soils, are shown in
Table2. Note that this coverage contains polygon features and an annotation subclass, type.
Each coverage workspace has an INFO database stored under a subdirectory, info. Each .adf file in a coverage
folder is related to a pair of the .dat and .nit files in the INFO folder. The arc.dir file in the INFO directory is
used to keep track of which pair of .nit and .data files is related to which .adf file. Out of these three, ‘Shape
File’ is most suitable to create and it occupies less space. The creation of such files is done in “Arc Catalog”.
‘Arc Catalog’ is opened, a shape file is created and a name is given for the shape file, depending upon the layer
to be digitized, for., ‘Road’ for road network and ‘Slums’ for digitizing slums, and is added to the Arc Map.
According to the shape file created, the respective coverage layer of the map is also added to the Arc Map.
Keeping the ‘Editor’ toolbar in ‘Start Editing’ mode, all the layers are individually digitized by creating
individual shape files. The digitizing of ‘Ward Boundary’ can be seen in Fig.2. A shape file called ‘Ward
Boundary’ is created and its respective coverage file developed is added to the Arc Map and the digitization is
carried out. The edits are finally saved and stopped.
4. ATTRIBUTING
Attributes are alphanumeric data that are associated with features and are typically stored in separate
databases (some systems do integrate graphics and test). Attributes hold a variety of additional information for
features (Glenn E. Montgomery, 1993). Attributes are descriptive data providing information associated with the
geometrical data, and these are usually managed in external or internal GIS database management systems
(DBMS) (Markus, 2008).
GIS relates database records and their associated attribute data to a physical location, thereby creating a "smart
map". Visualization of discrete parts of these data on a GIS map is possible by layering the data into different
"themes" like aided high schools in the city, water distribution network, slum location, etc.). GIS applications
can then display the intersection of various "themes", as well as the spatial relationships between various
features (Vanier, 2004).
Once all the layers are digitized, they are attributed that is. the statistical data regarding each layer is
attached to it by entering the same in the ‘attribute table’. The ‘Attribute Table’ of each of the shape files is
opened. Depending on the data collected, other fields of the attribute table are created and shown in Fig 3. The
collected data is then entered into all the columns of the table. Thus Attribute tables showing the existing data as
well as the proposals data for each layer are prepared. The edits are saved and stopped. As the attribute table of a
layer having both the existing as well as the proposals data will be too long, separate layers and tables are
formed for both the data. In an empty Arc Map document, all the layers are opened or otherwise all the layers
are ‘Overlapped’ to have an analysis of complete layers. By selecting or ‘ticking on’ the layers we wish, we can
view the whole data regarding the respective layer. The layers can also be individually added to the Arc Map
and analyzed, if overlapping of all the layers becomes cumbersome.
5. APPLICATIONS
The GIS setup is now ready for implementation. It is used for the analysis of various layers as
following:Fig.4 shows the location of various ‘Aided High Schools’ in the city. All the details of each school are
known from the attribute table like, its name, location, total strength, staff particulars etc. The wards, which are
far flung areas of the city (like wards 24, 23, 1, 46…) have got no high schools with them and hence needs the
attention of policy maker for establishments of high schools. A command “total<=200” is given and all the
schools having their total strength less than 200 gets highlighted in the map along with their attributes as shown
in the figure 8. Hence the public can easily choose the ‘best school’ that suits them by knowing different details
through such kind of operations. Moreover, the government can easily identify the schools with lack of proper
standards, by such ‘commands’, and include them in its development schemes.
Fig.5 shows the statistics of water distribution network along different wards. One can simply know the
intensity of water distribution for various wards. From this the ratio of ‘population’ to number of ‘public taps’ is
calculated and found that ward 10 becomes the best served area and ward 2 becomes the least served area
Also in the areas where there are less house service connections, public taps and hand bores should be
more. But the situation is found to be quite contrary in most of the wards like in wards 15, 28, 21 etc.In Fig.6, the composition of traffic at major locations of the city is given. One can know the percentage of
‘passenger vehicles’, ‘goods vehicles’ and ‘others’ along the important locations for 24 hours. Out of these, the ‘Ramavarappadu circle’ is found to have heavy traffic composition with daily moving vehicles of 29859 and the
‘Vijayawada-Milavaram’ road has got minimum traffic volume with daily moving vehicles of 5536.
From Fig.7, the pollution concentrations for the two main centers of the city for., ‘Benz Circle’ and
‘Patamata Road’ are shown, from the figure, it is observed that the ‘RSPM’ and ‘NOx’ concentrations at the
Benz circle is more than the ‘city average’ concentrations which needs immediate attention where as for the
Patamata road, they are within the reasonable limits. Hence the policy maker should plan accordingly to reduce
the pollution in the area of Benz circle, by minimizing the traffic volume and planning for alternative routes of
travel.Fig.8 shows the location of various ‘slums’ in the city. The details of all the slums for., its name,
location, BPL (Below Poverty Line) families, BPL population in each ward etc. have been shown. By clicking a
particular slum by the ‘identification icon’, one can get the complete details of it as entered in the attribute table.
The number of slums having more BPL families is also be identified by the ‘commands’ as described earlier for
the ‘Aided High Schools’ layer which is more useful for the government to implement its development schemes
according to their requirements. The ratio of ‘total population’ to the ‘Number of families’ is calculated and it is
found that ward 25 is likely to have more number of poor families.Fig.9 shows the distribution of ‘Railway Network’ across the city. The extent of commercial area in
different wards is known and hence proposals for foot-over bridges and fly-overs are to be planned accordingly.
Wards 25 and 26 have good commercial area and so, there is urgent need of fly-overs and foot-over bridges in
these areas.
6. CONCLUSIONS
GIS, a database management system, is all pervasing effect of every individual’s life. The development
of land use planning for Vijayawada urban area is implemented in GIS platform by generating different layers
like Aided high schools in the city, Water Distribution network, Slum location, Railway network etc. By the
integration of all these information, the decision maker can come to take right decisions without wasting much
time in correlating data from different sources.
